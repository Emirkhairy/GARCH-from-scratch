# GARCH from scratch

## Background
In this project, I am developing a GARCH model (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) without using any available frameworks like the ARCH library or Scikit-learn.

The GARCH model was first introduced by Bollerslev in 1986 and was initially used to predict UK inflation volatility. Unlike the ARCH model, GARCH is designed to predict the volatility of returns.

As someone with a background in finance, I find exploring the GARCH model particularly interesting. I hope this final project will be a starting point for further exploration of various time-series models in the near future.
